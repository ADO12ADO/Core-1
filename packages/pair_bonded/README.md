# Astroport Pair Bonded Package

Pair bonded package gives a trait that allows implementation pairs with bonded assets(e.g. ASTRO-xASTRO, MARS-xMARS, and other tokens that are correlated but have an increasing exchange rate compared to the other token).
Use [Pair ASTRO-xASTRO](/contracts/pair_astro_xastro/) as example of template implementation.
