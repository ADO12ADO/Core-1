# Astroport Factory

The factory contract can create new Astroport pair contracts (and associated LP token contracts) and it is used as a directory for all pairs. The default pair types are constant product and stableswap but governance may decide to add custom pools that can have any implementation. Its interface can be found [here](../../packages/factory/README.md)
