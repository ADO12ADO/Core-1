# Astroport xASTRO Staking

This staking contract allows ASTRO holders to stake their tokens in exchange for xASTRO. The amount of ASTRO they can claim later increases as accrued fees in the Maker contract get swapped to ASTRO which is then sent to stakers. Its interface can be found [here](../../../packages/staking/README.md)
