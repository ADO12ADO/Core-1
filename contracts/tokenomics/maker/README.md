# Astroport Maker

The Maker contract collects part of Astroport's pair fees (according to the factory's `maker_fee`). The accrued fees are swapped to ASTRO and then send to stakers and governance (according to the `governance_percent`). Its interface can be found [here](../../../packages/maker/README.md)
